# IB-Past-Paper-Sorter
A file sorter specifically made for IBDP past paper repositories. 

Simple to use. Change file path to the root path of the folder you are trying to sort. 
For papers you are look looking to keep, insert the naming scheme using regex.
All papers not matching REGEX scheme will be deleted.

Please make a backup of files before running.

Tweaking regex takes a bit of time.
